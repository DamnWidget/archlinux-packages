Just a collection of customized archlinux packages

Each package has its own readme with instructions to build and install

### Packages

* [linux-kernel](https://github.com/DamnWidget/archlinux-packages/tree/master/core/linux) with BFQ IO Scheduler, AUFS and Corsair drivers for input devices
* [steam](https://github.com/DamnWidget/archlinux-packages/tree/master/multilib/steam) with common patches applied, pretty much the same as `steam-manjaro`
